"""

    description = f"""
Design a complete meal plan for a single day that matches the nutritional targets.

**YOUR ROLE**: You are the SUPERVISOR. You DESIGN meals using your culinary expertise.
You do NOT make any tool calls. A separate Executor agent will validate your
ingredient choices against the Passio food database.

**CRITICAL**: You MUST create exactly {meal_count} meals, one for each Hexis target:
  → {meal_types_str}

DAILY TARGET:
{target_json}

WEEKLY CONTEXT (use for variety and strategy):
{weekly_json}

EXISTING DAYS TO AVOID DUPLICATES:
{previous_days_json}
{feedback_section}{variety_context}

⚠️ MANDATORY ROOT FIELDS - YOUR JSON MUST INCLUDE THESE (validation fails without them):
Copy these EXACT values from the DAILY TARGET above into your JSON response:
  "target_calories": {day_target_calories}
  "target_protein": {day_target_protein}
  "target_carbs": {day_target_carbs}
  "target_fat": {day_target_fat}

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS - MealPlanTemplate JSON:

Return a JSON object with exactly {meal_count} meals in the "meals" array.
Each meal MUST match one of the Hexis meal targets below.

}}
```

HEXIS MEAL TARGETS - CREATE ONE MEAL FOR EACH (exactly {meal_count} meals):
{meal_targets_section}

CARBCODE GUIDANCE:
- LOW: Prioritize proteins (chicken, fish, eggs), healthy fats (avocado, nuts, olive oil),
       low-GI vegetables (leafy greens, broccoli, zucchini)
- MEDIUM: Balanced carbs from whole grains (quinoa, brown rice), fruits, starchy vegetables
- HIGH: High-carb recovery foods (pasta, white rice, bread), sports nutrition, fruits

CARB QUANTITY REFERENCE (use these values for accurate estimation):
- 100g cooked rice = 23g carbs
- 100g cooked pasta = 25g carbs
- 100g cooked quinoa = 21g carbs
- 1 slice bread (30g) = 15g carbs
- 100g potato = 17g carbs
- 100g sweet potato = 20g carbs
- 100g banana = 23g carbs
- 100g berries = 10g carbs
- 100g oats (dry) = 66g carbs → use 40g dry oats = 26g carbs for breakfast
- 100g Greek yogurt = 4g carbs

Example to hit 45g carbs:
- Option A: 150g rice (35g) + 50g berries (5g) + vegetables (5g) = 45g
- Option B: 100g pasta (25g) + 80g banana (18g) + vegetables (2g) = 45g

INGREDIENT NAMING RULES (CRITICAL for Executor validation):
- Use SIMPLE, COMMON ingredient names
- Include quantities in grams when possible
- Examples of GOOD names: "chicken breast", "brown rice", "olive oil", "eggs"
- Examples of BAD names: "free-range chicken", "artisanal bread", "specialty cheese"
- The Executor will search the Passio database for these exact terms

MACRO ESTIMATION:
- Match each meal's macros to the Hexis targets as closely as possible
- Aim for each meal within ±10% of its Hexis target
- Daily totals should be within ±5% of the day's target
- The Reviewer will verify against Hexis targets

⚠️ MANDATORY VALIDATION - VERIFY BEFORE SUBMITTING:
Before finalizing, SUM your meal macros and VERIFY they match the daily targets:
- Sum of all meal calories MUST equal ~{day_target_calories} kcal (tolerance: ±50 kcal)
- Sum of all meal protein MUST equal ~{day_target_protein}g (tolerance: ±5g)
- Sum of all meal carbs MUST equal ~{day_target_carbs}g (tolerance: ±5g)
- Sum of all meal fat MUST equal ~{day_target_fat}g (tolerance: ±5g)

If your totals don't match, ADJUST ingredient quantities before submitting.
Example: If carbs are 40g over target, reduce rice by 170g (170g rice = ~40g carbs).

VARIETY RULES:
- Do not repeat meals from EXISTING DAYS
- Rotate protein sources, cuisines, and cooking methods
- Use seasonal ingredients when possible
- Prioritize FROZEN vegetables for convenience

PRACTICAL CONSTRAINTS:
- Breakfast prep: <15 minutes
- Snack prep: <10 minutes
- Lunch/Dinner prep: <45 minutes
- Use ingredients from French supermarkets (Leclerc, Carrefour)
- Never use smoked salmon (user preference)
- Never use cheese (user preference) - EXCEPTION: mascarpone is allowed
- Never use carbonated drinks (user preference)

Return ONLY valid JSON without markdown fences or commentary.
